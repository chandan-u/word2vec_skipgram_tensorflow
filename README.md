# word2vec skipGram model

Implementing word2vec: skipgram model using tensorflow core API


## Dataset:
Blog posts


## Implementation:

The word2vec model uses the skipgram approach to train and generate the word vectors. The implementation uses Tensorflow Core API. The nework is a computational graph with a single hidden layer.

A good example on how to use tensorflow core API to build neural networks and how to train them
